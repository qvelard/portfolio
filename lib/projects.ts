      Built a full-featured e-commerce dashboard that provides store owners with comprehensive insights into their business. 
      The application features real-time sales analytics, inventory management, customer insights, and order processing capabilities.
      
      Key challenges included implementing real-time data synchronization across multiple users, optimizing performance for large datasets, 
      and creating an intuitive interface that works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.
      
      The solution leverages React with TypeScript for type safety, Socket.io for real-time updates, and a microservices architecture 
      to ensure scalability and maintainability.

      'Catastrophic forgetting is a key problem this paper addresses. In both classical and quantum machine learning, this happens when a model learns new information but loses its ability to remember older knowledge‚Äîlike forgetting how to ride a bike after learning to drive a car. The authors show this issue exists in variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), a type of quantum machine learning model, and aim to fix it.',
      '',
      'QILLER combines several cool techniques to solve this: representation learning, knowledge distillation, and exemplar memory. These work together to help the model learn new tasks incrementally while holding onto past knowledge, all within a quantum computing framework.',
      '',
      'The goal is lifelong learning, inspired by how humans can keep learning new skills without forgetting old ones. The authors test their method on datasets like MNIST (handwritten digits), FMNIST (fashion items), KMNIST (Japanese characters), and CIFAR-10 (color images), showing it outperforms other approaches.',
      '',
      'üóùÔ∏è Key Concepts Explained',
      'Catastrophic Forgetting: Imagine training a quantum classifier to recognize quantum phases of matter (a physics task), and it works great. Then, you train it on handwritten digits (like 0s and 1s). Suddenly, it forgets the physics task entirely! That\'s catastrophic forgetting, and the paper gives this exact example from prior research to highlight the issue in VQAs.',
      '',
      'Representation Learning: This is about transforming messy data (like images) into a simpler, more useful form‚Äîlike summarizing a book into key points. Here, it\'s done with a quantum autoencoder, which compresses classical data into a quantum state that\'s easier for the model to work with.',
      '',
      'Knowledge Distillation: Think of it as a student learning from a teacher. The "teacher" is the model\'s past knowledge, and the "student" is the updated model. It uses a special loss function to ensure the new model mimics what the old one knew, preventing forgetting.',
      '',
      'Exemplar Memory: This acts like a scrapbook of important examples. It stores a small, representative set of samples from old tasks (picked using a method called herding selection) so the model can revisit them and remember past lessons.',
      '',
      'üîß How QILLER Works',
      'Two-Part Architecture: QILLER splits into a feature extractor and a classifier. The feature extractor uses a quantum autoencoder (QAE) to turn classical data into quantum features‚Äîa 64-dimensional vector‚Äîtrained once with supervised contrastive loss and then frozen. The classifier, a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC), predicts classes using these features.',
      '',
      'Incremental Learning Steps: It starts by training on the first task with cross-entropy loss. As new tasks come in, the VQC updates using a mix of cross-entropy loss (for new classes) and distillation loss (to keep old knowledge), referencing past outputs stored in exemplar memory. After each step, the memory updates with new representative samples.',
      '',
      'Loss Function Magic: The loss combines cross-entropy for new learning and distillation to retain old knowledge, with a temperature parameter (T=2) balancing it. It\'s optimized with COBYLA, a gradient-free method suited for quantum circuits.',
      '',
      'üìà Experimental Results',
      'Impressive Numbers: QILLER was tested on MNIST, FMNIST, KMNIST, and CIFAR-10. On MNIST, it hit 29% accuracy for 10 classes (1-class-per-step) versus 9-27% for rivals like SCL-VQC, iCaRL-VQC, and TL-VQC. On FMNIST, it scored 28%, beating TL-VQC (19%). KMNIST saw 24%, topping others (12-15%). CIFAR-10 achieved 16%, outperforming TL-VQC (9%).',
      '',
      'Real Quantum Hardware: Tested on Amazon Braket\'s IonQ Harmony (11 qubits) and simulators, it proves practical even with limits like resizing images to 16x16 pixels.',

      'Real-World Ready: QILLER tackles continuous data streams (think smart cities or social media) where new info keeps coming, unlike older methods that struggle with scalability or forget too much.',
      '',
      'Efficient Design: It uses fewer qubits and discards old VQCs after training, saving quantum resources while still learning effectively.',
      '',
      'Beats the Competition: Outperforms methods like iCaRL-VQC (memory-heavy) and SCL-VQC (less adaptive) by balancing feature extraction and classification in a quantum way.',
